This is my discord bot. It has some commands. If you don't know what they are, that's what this repo is for.

# Running yourself

I don't know why you'd want to run this yourself, unless you are trying to contribute to it, but here's how you do it.
1. Clone the repo with 
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/SmallPepperZ/SachiBotPy
	```
2. Setup the virtual environment
 
   a. Manually
   	```bash 
	python3 -m venv venv                       # Creates a virtual environment
  	source venv/bin/activate                   # Activates the virtual environment
  	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs dependencies into the virtual environemnt
	```
	
	**OR**
  
	b. With the setup script
	```bash
	sh ./setup
3. ??? (I will update this page with information on the config files)
4. Profit
